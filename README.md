# Python Challenge

For the PyBank and PyPoll Challenges, I crafted Python scripts to analyze financial records and election data, calculating key metrics like total months, net profit/loss, vote percentages, and identifying significant profit changes and the election winner. My code efficiently processed large datasets, outputting results to both the terminal and text files.
